# Length of Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the classic problem:

> **Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.**

##  Problem Explanation

You are given a string and need to find the length of the **longest substring** in it that contains **no repeating characters**.

For example:

- Input: `"abcabcbb"` → Output: `3` (`"abc"`)
- Input: `"bbbbb"` → Output: `1` (`"b"`)
- Input: `"pwwkew"` → Output: `3` (`"wke"`)
